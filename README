Convert a source image into sizes suitable for use in an HTML <img> tag's srcset attribute.

Requires python and that imagemagick's identify and convert commands to be
installed.

Usage:

~$ mkdir /tmp/imgsrcset-test/
~$ imgsrcset /tmp/source.jpg 320 640 1200 -o /tmp/imgsrcset-test/
~$ ls /tmp/imgsrcset-test/
source-320w.jpg  source-640w.jpg

Note that `-o` is optional. If you do not supply an output path, the path that
the original source image is located in will be used.
